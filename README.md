## 🚀 Who Am I?

I’m an Android Engineer with 3.5+ years of experience building real-world mobile applications used in production environments.

<i>"Architecture is what remains when the code evolves."</i>

I focus on writing modular, maintainable, and scalable applications that remain stable even as features grow.

My work spans across:

- Health-tech systems with secure multi-user access  
- Logistics platforms with live location tracking  
- Insurance apps with Google wallet integration  
- Real-time chat systems  
- IoT monitoring applications using MQTT  

---

## 🧠 How I Build Apps

Before writing code, I usually think:

- Is this simple and readable?
- Can I extend this feature later without rewriting everything?
- Is the logic properly structured?
- Will this remain stable in production?

<i>"Clean architecture is not a pattern — it is a discipline."</i>

My approach centers around:

`MVVM` • `Clean Architecture` • `SOLID Principles`  
`Dependency Injection (Hilt / Dagger)`  
Reactive streams using `Coroutines`, `Flow`, and `RxJava`
